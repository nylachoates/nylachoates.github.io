                 My name is Nyla Chavon Choates, and I was born and raised in Milpitas, California.  I attend Milpitas High school as an incoming sophomore.  I am apart of the Thespian society, which is our schools theatre club. As a Freshman I played a lead role in the school musical production of Hairspray. I have a huge passion for sports, playing basketball, volleyball, and track. Outside of the school, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. When I grow up I would like to become an entrepreneur and start my own business. Along with starting my own business, I am interested in becoming a cardiol

            My three personal goals are; to build my self confidence, make my family proud, and to continue to become a better leader.Building up my self confidence and love for myself is a very important goal of mine because I know you have to love yourself before you can love anyone else. I’ve had many difficulties and challenges with my self confidence but each and everyday I gain a little more. So my overall goal is to have full and complete love for everything about myself. My second goal is to make my family proud of me and who I’ve become.  The reason this is one of my goals is because my family has done so much for me, the least I could do was to make them proud f he person I’ve become. My family not only raised me, but they also support me in anything and everything I do. They are the people that I know love me unconditionally, no matter what mistakes I make. So I can’t wait to repay them for all of the things they have done for me, by succeeding in everything I do.My last personal goal is to become an even better leader. I just recently learned how to be my own person, and not follow the crowd. So my next goal is to start leading others to become their own person, and lead them to make the right choices in life. I know if I work hard on all of these goals I will be able to turn each of them into a reality.
